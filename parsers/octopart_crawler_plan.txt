general idea:
build a crawler that is fed parts list and a url and it outputs pages within the same url 
ranked according to the frequency of parts mentioned



toDo:
1. parse the octopart CPL page


Octopart collaboration plan:
- a mentor with one weekly skype session and continuous github support on the code
- 2 months of volunteer work, after which we re-evaluate the further collaboration
- the goal:
	to write several site-specific crawlers
		- dangerous prototypes
		- github => eagle / KiCad
	write one generic crawler which indexes pages according the parts list mentions
	


Notes for Sam:
- Incorrect listing of Molex - 480-37-1000 in the 'USB A Female connector' field
- Very strange price for microSD card connector https://octopart.com/st9s008v4ar1500-jae%2Belectronics-19043725
